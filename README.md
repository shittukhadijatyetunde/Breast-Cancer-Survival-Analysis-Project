# I developed a predictive model for breast cancer survival outcomes utilizing a combination of Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and a supplementary model the Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) with a dataset containing 4,024 records. Rigorous preprocessing, including outlier treatment, feature engineering, and feature selection, ensured the robustness of the models. The RSF model was implemented to capture non-linear interactions and hierarchical patterns in the data, while the GBM model explored additive relationships between predictors. Model evaluation was conducted using survival-specific metrics, with the Cox model achieving a C-index of 0.751, the RSF model scoring 0.731, and the GBM model scoring lower at 0.251. This analysis demonstrated the ability of the RSF to provide competitive performance compared to traditional Cox models, particularly in scenarios with complex interactions, although Cox still slightly outperformed in accuracy. These findings emphasize the utility of RSF in supplementing gaps in traditional survival analysis methods, particularly for non-linear relationships and feature complexity.
